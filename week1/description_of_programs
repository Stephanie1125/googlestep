The following is the description of the programs and practices I did for the first week homework:


1. week1_hw.py / week1_hw.cpp

First week's homework for Google STEP:
与えられてあ16文字からなるべく長い単語を出力するプログラムをつくろう！
Given 16 letters and try to output the longest word using 16 letters.

Example:
Input: aehmnooqqrrstzzz
Output: astronomer


2. week1.practice.py / week1.practice.cpp

First week's practice for Google STEP:
Given 16 letters and output all possible words with len(word) > 8.
Set the length limit in order to decrease the numbers of output.

Example:
Input: aehmnooqqrrstzzz
Output:
astronomer
hoarstone
anorthose
resonator


3. week1_anagram.py

This program is for practicing anagram:
Find anagram for only one word (no space)

Example input/output:
1.
Input: sister
Output: ['resist', 'restis', 'sister']
2.
Input: smile
Output: ['limes', 'slime', 'smile']
